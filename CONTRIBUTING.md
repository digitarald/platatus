## Adding a new Feature to track

The easiest way to add a new feature is to use github's online file editor and create a new pull request from there.

1. Create a [new file](https://github.com/mozilla/platatus/new/master/features) in the `features` folder and name it to reflect the feature name. The filename should end with the `.md` extension, be short, be descriptive, be lowercase, and use-dashes-for-spaces.
1. Copy the contents [feature-template.md](https://github.com/mozilla/platatus/blob/master/feature-template.md) into the file.
1. Fill as many values (documented below) as possible in `<the-feature>.md`.
1. Create a pull request from the online editor, or if you're using git from the command line follow the usual steps for making a pull request.

## Should we add Feature X?

This list isn't definitive, but a feature makes a good candidate if any of the following are true:

* a standardization process has started
* major browsers have started implementing it or are experimenting with it
* it has been requested by web designers/developers

## Developing the Site

* Try to work on [open issues](https://github.com/mozilla/platatus/issues) or create a [new issue](https://github.com/mozilla/platatus/issues/new) before starting work.
* Follow the style in the file and make sure to run `npm test`.
* The minimum supported Node.js version is 4.
